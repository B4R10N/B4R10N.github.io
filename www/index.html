                 My name is Alexander Nunes, I am a 22 year-old who started studying Games Design at Bournemouth University<br>
                 to fulfill my dream of becoming part of a team who will develop a game that will stay in people's memories<br>
                 for years to come. I aspire to be a level-designer that can recreate astonishing worlds and spaces that<br>
                 make the player pull up for a second and admire the beauty of a digital world.

			 <h1> My Story</h1>
			 
			 <br>
			 
			 
			 <div id="intro2">
			     I came to the UK in March of 2018 due to economical issues that my family and I were facing. I was born in<br>
				 Venezuela but grew up in Portugal, specifically in the Island of Madeira since 2004. Ever since I arrived <br>
				 we were in an ever-developing situation that improved as time went by. I managed to qualify to BU in just  <br>
				 2 years and a half and study what I loved most: videogames. I possess very few skills in comparisson to my <br>
				 classmates, but that did not cross me as troublesome one bit since the course is suited for people with no <br>
				 previous skills. And there you go, that is my story.

	         <div id="intro3">
			     I obtained my Level 2s back in Venezuela and got a GSCE equivalent of Maths, due to English being studied <br>
				 as a second language, it was not valid. To compensate this, a Level 2 in Functional Skills English served <br>
				 as sufficient to meet any university requirements. My Level 3 consists of a Diploma of Access to Higher   <br>
				 Education in IT Computing that I obtained in 2019 through Bournemouth and Poole College. Finally, in order<br>
				 to qualify for any university I overtook an online IELTS examination and got a score of 7.9. This proved <br>
                 that my English profficiency was above the threshold of acceptance.
